I do not use Windows, and so I lack access to Visual Studio.

The project definition (.vcxproj) was rolled by me. It serves as a template that requires no manual changes. All .c and .h files in the src directory are added into the project.

Microsoft's own SlnGen is the tool I use to generate the project solution (.sln).

GUIDGen.sh is a POSIX shell script that generates a new GUID, installs it in the project defenition, and generates the project solution with SlnGen.

This is ONLY for C projects. In the future I will probably make a C++ verison.

If anything is broken or dysfunctional, it might be a result of this hacky solutionâ€¦

I'm pretty certain that it's fine. But just in case, I want to make you aware.

Thank you, Benjamin Carpenter
